My name is Seonjin Na. I am a PhD student in the School of Computing at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://kaist.ac.kr)advised by Prof. [Jaehyuk Huh](http://calab.kaist.ac.kr:8080/~jhuh).  

My research interests are hardware-based security and accelerats(GPUs, ASICs). You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
