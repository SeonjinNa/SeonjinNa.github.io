I am a PhD student in the School of Computing at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://kaist.ac.kr)advised by Prof. [Jaehyuk Huh](http://calab.kaist.ac.kr:8080/~jhuh). Prior to KAIST, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engeenering <strong>SUMMA CUM LAUDE</strong> at [Sogang University](https://sogang.ac.kr).

My research interests in computer architecture and security include trusted execution environment support for accelerators (GPUs, NPUs), Multi-GPU architectures.
