I am currently 	a Postdoctoral Researcher in [HPArch Group](https://sites.gatech.edu/hparch/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) advised by Prof. [Hyesoon Kim](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/hyesoon-kim). Prior to Georgia tech, I received a Ph.D in Computer Science from KAIST (2023), an M.S from KAIST (2016), and a B.S in Computer Science Engeenering from [Sogang University](https://sogang.ac.kr) (<strong>SUMMA CUM LAUDE</strong>).

My research interests lie in GPU architecture, trusted computing, heterogeneous systems, distributed computing, and systems for machine learning. My current research focuses on building secure architecture 
to provide the trusted execution environment(TEE) on accelerators such as GPUs, and NPUs with low-performance overhead.
